# Wrapper Method Projects
This project explores predicting obesity status (NObeyesdad) using survey-based lifestyle and demographic data.

In this project , a Logistic Regression model is used as the baseline classifier, and multiple feature selection techniques are applied to evaluate how different subsets of predictors affect model accuracy.

The dataset contains 18 predictor variables related to eating habits, physical activity, demographics, and lifestyle choices. The target variable NObeyesdad is binary, indicating whether a respondent is obese (1) or not (0).
